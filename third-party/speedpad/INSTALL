Speedpad is written as a single executable called ``speedpad``.

This allows easy distribution and installation.

:Package maintainers:

  Please use "speedpad" for the final package and executable name.

  This allows users on different platforms to find it easily.


Requirements
============

**Speedpad is written in pure Python and has no external dependencies!**

* `Python 2.7 <http://python.org/>`_ or later (no Python 3 support yet)

If no other input is provided, speedpad tries to loop on fortunes generated by
the famous ``fortune`` program. For the full out of the box
experience, you should install fortune, and packagers should make sure their
speedpad package recommends it.

* `fortune <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28Unix%29>`_

If you want to visualize your typing statistics, consider installing
``gnuplot`` or something similar. Packagers should suggest gnuplot in their
speedpad package.

* `gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.info/>`_
